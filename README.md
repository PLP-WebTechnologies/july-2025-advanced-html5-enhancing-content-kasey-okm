# Kasey Portfolio

A personal portfolio project demonstrating advanced HTML5 content structuring, accessibility, and form validation. This project is part of the "Advanced HTML5: Enhancing Content" assignment.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Uses `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and other semantic elements for clarity and accessibility.
- **Organized Content:** Includes lists, tables, and embedded media (images and audio) to showcase skills and projects.
- **Accessible Navigation:** Keyboard-accessible navigation with `accesskey` attributes and ARIA labels.
- **Advanced HTML5 Form:**  
  - Multiple input types (text, email, tel, select, textarea, radio, checkbox)

  - Native HTML5 validation (`required`, `pattern`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `readonly`, etc.)
  - Accessible labels for all form fields

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/july-2025-advanced-html5-enhancing-content-kasey-okm.git
   ```

## Project Structure

## Accessibility & Best Practices
